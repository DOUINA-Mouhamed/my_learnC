# Learn-C
Hey !  🤙  Welcome to my free C learning course dedicated for post-pool {EPITECH} students.  🚀

You will be discovering new things and simple concepts you have not seen in the pool that might interest you. Moreover,  further in the year, this repository can be a tool for you to exercise over concepts you may have forgotten about. It is composed of easy mini-projects such as a terminal tic-tac-toe game, or even mathematics projects such as calculating the circumference of a circle. It contains important reminder of how a pointer works, for example, or how to deal with struct and reading files 🗞️.
