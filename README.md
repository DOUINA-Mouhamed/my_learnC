# my_learnC
Hey !  🤙  Welcome to my free C learning course dedicated for post-pool {EPITECH} students.

You will be discovering new things and simple concepts you have not seen in the pool that might interest you. Moreover,  further in the year, this repository can be a tool for you to exercise over concepts you may have forgotten about. It is composed of easy mini-projects such as a terminal tic-tac-toe game, or even mathematics projects such as calculating the circumference of a circle. It contains important reminder of how a pointer works, for example, or how to deal with struct and reading files 🗞️.

**Here is the roadmap of this repository**

* Step 1 : In the ```basics``` repository, you will take your first step into your revisions or your learning of C. It is not a step that would be time consumming, but it is always important to go back to the basics to consolidate all of your knowledge.

* Step 2 : You're done consolidating your knowledge 🥳 ! After finishing the ```basics``` repository, you can start practising the skills you have obtained to make two easy exercices that are mathematic related : ```1_my_circumferense.txt``` and ```2_my_hypotenuse.txt``` 📐. You can find the corrections in the ```mini-projects``` repository, but I advice you to really try to make it on your own ! You can do it for sure ✔️.
