# my_learnC
## Hey! 👋 Welcome to my free C learning course dedicated to post-pool {EPITECH} students.

You will discover new things and simple concepts you have not seen in the pool that might interest you. Moreover, further in the year, this repository can be a tool for you to exercise over concepts you may have forgotten. It is composed of easy mini-projects such as a terminal tic-tac-toe game or even mathematical projects such as calculating the circumference of a circle. It contains important reminders of how a pointer works, for example, or how to deal with struct and reading files 🗞️.

## How it works 🧰

You have multiple directories in this repo. First, you will have to clone it using the ```git clone``` command. Secondly, you can see that there is an empty directory called ['my_mini_projects'](my_mini_projects). You will create your C files here when you arrive at the ['exercises'](exercises) step 💻.

## Roadmap 📰

### Part 1: Basics of C Programming

* Step 1 : In the ['basics'](my_learnC/part_1/01_basics) directory, you will take your first step into your revisions or your learning of C. It is not a step that would be time consumming, but it is always important to go back to the basics in order to consolidate all of your knowledge.

* Step 2: You're done consolidating your knowledge 🥳 ! After finishing the ```basics``` directory, you can start using the skills you have obtained to make two easy exercises that are mathematic related : ['my_circumference.pdf'](exercises/01_my_circumference.pdf) and ['my_hypotenuse.pdf'](exercises/'02_my_hypotenuse.pdf) 📐. Those PDF files can be found in the ['exercises'](exercises) directory. You can find the corrections in the ['corrections'](corrections) directory, but I advise you to really try to make it on your own ! You can do it for sure ✔️.

* Step 3: You have finished your mini-projects, and now you can finally step into the ['statements'](my_learnC/part_1/02_statements) directory. This repositery marks the end of the easiest side of this repository and now you are truly starting to be a C amateur 😉. This directory is shorter than the last one but stay focus ! After you are sure you've understood perfectly how ```if``` and ```switch``` statements works you can head to the next directory ['basicMakefile'](my_learnC/part_1/03_basicMakefile).

* Step 4: Before heading to the next exercises, you should complete the ```basicMakefile``` tutorial to understand how to make one, because you are going to write a Makefile for every next ['exercises'](exercises).

* Step 5: You're a rocket 🚀 ! Now that you are able to write a short Makefile without even using internet or the man, you can head to the next exercises to practise even more ! ['my_ticket'](exercises/03_my_ticket.pdf) and ['my_temp'](exercises/04_my_temp.pdf) are the next exercises you should complete before starting the ```Part 2``` of your journey.

* Step 6: The last thing to do before stepping into the next part is to complete the ['logical_operator'](my_learnC/part_1/04_logical_operators) course. 🚀

### Part 2: C Programming Essentials
