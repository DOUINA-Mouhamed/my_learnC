# my_learnC
Hey !  ü§ô  Welcome to my free C learning course dedicated for post-pool {EPITECH} students.

You will be discovering new things and simple concepts you have not seen in the pool that might interest you. Moreover,  further in the year, this repository can be a tool for you to exercise over concepts you may have forgotten about. It is composed of easy mini-projects such as a terminal tic-tac-toe game, or even mathematics projects such as calculating the circumference of a circle. It contains important reminder of how a pointer works, for example, or how to deal with struct and reading files üóûÔ∏è.

**If you want to integrate Epitech** you are not advised to take this course, and you should wait after your pool to do it. You will have to install a gcc compiler, or even switch to linux if you can't do it on Windows. Moreover, you will have to learn about compiling a program and learning how a terminal works. {EPITECH} will teach you all of this in your first days of pool.

**Here is the roadmap of this repository**

* Step 1 : In the ```basics``` repository, you will take your first step into your revisions or your learning of C. It is not a step that would be time consumming, but it is always important to go back to the basics to consolidate all of your knowledge.

* Step 2 : You're done consolidating your knowledge ü•≥ ! After finishing the ```basics``` repository, you can start practising the skills you have obtained to make two easy exercices that are mathematic related : ```1_my_circumferense.txt``` and ```2_my_hypotenuse.txt``` üìê. You can find the corrections in the ```mini-projects``` repository, but I advice you to really try to make it on your own ! You can do it for sure ‚úîÔ∏è.
