# my_learnC
## Hey !  👋  Welcome to my free C learning course dedicated for post-pool {EPITECH} students.

You will be discovering new things and simple concepts you have not seen in the pool that might interest you. Moreover,  further in the year, this repository can be a tool for you to exercise over concepts you may have forgotten about. It is composed of easy mini-projects such as a terminal tic-tac-toe game, or even mathematics projects such as calculating the circumference of a circle. It contains important reminder of how a pointer works, for example, or how to deal with struct and reading files 🗞️.

## If you want to integrate Epitech

You are not advised to take this course, and you should wait after your pool to do it. You will have to install a gcc compiler, or even switch to linux if you can't do it on Windows. Moreover, you will have to learn about compiling a program and learning how a terminal works. {EPITECH} will teach you all of this in your first days of pool.

## How it works

You have multiple directories in this repo. First you will have to clone it using the ```git clone``` command. Secondly, you can see that there is an empty directory called ```my_mini_projects```. You will create your C files here when you arrive at the ```exercises``` step 💻.

## Here is the roadmap of this repository

### Part 1

* Step 1 : In the [my_learnC/01_basics](my_learnC/01_basics) directory, you will take your first step into your revisions or your learning of C. It is not a step that would be time consumming, but it is always important to go back to the basics in order to consolidate all of your knowledge.

* Step 2 : You're done consolidating your knowledge 🥳 ! After finishing the ```basics``` directory, you can start using the skills you have obtained to make two easy exercices that are mathematic related : ```my_circumferense.pdf``` and ```my_hypotenuse.pdf``` 📐. Those pdf files can be found in the ```exercises``` directory. You can find the corrections in the ```corrections``` directory, but I advice you to really try to make it on your own ! You can do it for sure ✔️.

* Step 3 : You have finished your mini-projects, and now you can finally step into the ```my_learnC/02_statements``` directory. This repositery marks the end of the easiest side of this repository and now you are truly starting to be a C amateur 😉. This directory is shorter than the last one but stay focus ! After you are sure you've understood perfectly how ```if``` and ```switch``` statements works you can head to the next directory ```my_learnC/03_basicMakefile```.

* Step 4 : Before heading to the next exercices, you should complete the ```basicMakefile``` tutorial to understand how to make one, because you are going to write a Makefile for every next ```exercices```.
